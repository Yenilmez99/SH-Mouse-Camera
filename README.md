Releases is Reloaded 2 Mod Loader File

It is recommended that the resolution be 1024+. This is because the cursor is set to 800x600 when using the mode.

It is activated automatically when entering any stage.

There are some animation bugs due to the camera being assigned to the mouse. Holding down the N key until these bugs disappear temporarily solves the problem.

Keys:

N = As long as the button is held down, the Camera Returns to the Original Camera Layout of Sonic Heroes. When any animation bug occurs, press and hold it until the problem is resolved. (for example, when you start the metal sonic stage, the metal sonic bug will remain and the game will not start or power characters can sometimes shake the screen with their hits and the screen always remains shaken. Holding the N key for about 10 seconds fixes the problem)

U = Forcefully terminates the DLL File when an unresolved game bug occurs. The camera may freeze in mid-air.
